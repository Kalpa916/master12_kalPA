from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class CUser(User):
    score = models.IntegerField()

The custom user has an additional field (“score”), we want to do the following operations using ORM queries only. Every answer must have a single query:

Calculate the mean score of all users.
Find the user with the highest score.
Change the score value of all users in a single query to 100 (one hundred)
User.obj...all().update(score=100)
